# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL
This project involves an in-depth analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQL. The aim was to explore and uncover significant trends, patterns, and insights from the vast amount of data generated during the pandemic. By utilizing various SQL techniques, I provided a comprehensive analysis that could help stakeholders better understand the impact of COVID-19 and inform decision-making processes.


## What I Did:

- I began by extracting the raw COVID-19 data from various sources and importing it into SQL Server.
- The data was highly fragmented, with different datasets covering cases, deaths, vaccinations, and testing across multiple countries and timeframes.
-  I transformed the data by using SQL techniques like data cleaning, converting data types, and ensuring consistency across different datasets.


## Data Analysis:



- Global Metrics Analysis: I analyzed global COVID-19 metrics such as the total number of cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. This included calculating the death percentage, infection rates, and vaccination coverage across different countries.
- Time Series Analysis: I performed time series analysis to track the progression of cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time, identifying key trends and patterns.
-  Country-wise Analysis: I broke down the data by country, identifying countries with the highest and lowest infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress.

- Vaccination Impact Analysis: I explored the correlation between vaccination rates and the reduction in case numbers and deaths, providing insights into the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.

## Visualization and Reporting:



- The results of the analysis were structured into detailed reports that provided clear, actionable insights.

- I also created views to enable quick access to the most critical data points, allowing for easy retrieval and further analysis.





## Impact

This project provided key stakeholders with actionable insights into the progression and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling data-driven decisions in public health strategies and resource allocation
